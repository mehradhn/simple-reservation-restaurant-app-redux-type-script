at first install redux toolkit application




steps:
    1- set up our store:
            1)In src: create directory called app
            2)at app: create store.ts
            3)configure store:
                                import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

            4) now export store 
                    export const store = configureStore({
                                                        reducer: {},
                                                                    });

            5) now export fancy stuff for ts:
                                            export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
                                            export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;

    2-now concent store to react app go to the App or index
            1:import Provider from react-redux library
            2:in index import store and pass it to Provider
    
    3-now in src create features directory:
            1:first import createSlice method from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
            2:
                export const reservationSlice = createSlice({
                     name:"reservations",
                     initialState,
                     reducers:{}
                     }) 

            notice: you can define initialState outside of slicer
            3: for now we want to export whole slice, for do that:
                                            export default reservationSlice.reducer



            4-for write reducers, you should write an arrow
            function,
            this function give state and action
            notice you specified type of action, so at first
            you import {PayloadAction} from  "@reduxjs/toolkit"
            so you wite like that
                addReservation: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
                            state.value.push(action.payload);
                    },

            
            and also you should define type for initialState 
            
            interface reservationState {
                     value: string[];
            }

            5- at the end you should export actions so 
            export const {} = felanSlicers.actions

    4-now we go the App.tsx and at first we try to grab globalstate from slicer
    for do this we used useSelector
    for do that:
                1- import {useSelector} from "react-redux"
                2- we create const and with useSelector we try to give globalstate
                const reservations = useSelector((state) => state.reservations.value)

                in redux, we need to dispatch an action
                so for use action you should import dispatch then import actions
